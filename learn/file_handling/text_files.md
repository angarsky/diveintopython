Text files are used to store and read data, such as a simple text document or database output. Python offers various ways to work with [Text Files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file), including reading, writing, and appending to files. Understanding how to handle text files is important for any programmer working in Python, as it can help them to efficiently manage and manipulate data within their program.  
  
## How to read text file in Python  

To read a text file in Python, you can use the built-in function `open()` to open the file in read mode. Here are 2 code examples:

### Open Text File

```python
with open('filename.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
```

Here, `open()` function opens the file `filename.txt` in read mode and returns a file object. The `with` statement is used to ensure that the file is properly closed after its use. `read()` function reads the contents of the file and stores it in the `content` variable.

### Reading Text File Line by Line

```python
with open('filename.txt', 'r') as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line)
```

Here, `open()` function opens the file `filename.txt` in read mode and returns a file object. The `with` statement is used to ensure that the file is properly closed after its use. `for` loop reads the file line by line and prints it on the console.

In both the examples, you can replace `filename.txt` with the path of the actual text file you want to read.  

## Write to a Text File in Python  

Writing to a text file in Python is a basic file operation that involves creating a new file, writing data to it, and optionally closing the file. Here are two examples of how to write to a text file in Python:

```python
file = open('example.txt', 'w')
file.write('Hello, world!')
file.close()
```

In this example, we create a new file called example.txt using the 'w' mode, which stands for write. Then, we use the `write()` method to add the string `Hello, world!` to the file. Finally, we close the file using the `close()` method.

```python
file = open('example.txt', 'w')
lines = ['Line 1\n', 'Line 2\n', 'Line 3\n']
file.writelines(lines)
file.close()
```

Here, we create a new file called example.txt and assign it to the `file` variable with the `w` mode. Then, we define three lines of text as a list of strings and assign it to the `lines` variable. We use the `writelines()` method to write all the lines to the text file. Finally, we close the file using the `close()` method.

### How to Get Python Output in Text File  

If you want to save the output of your Python code into a text file, you can use the `open()` function in Python.

```python
output = "Hello, world!"
with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write(output)
```

In this example, we have a string `output` that contains the text we want to save in the file. We open a file called `output.txt` in write mode using the `open()` function. Then, we use the `write()` method of the file object to save the contents of `output` into the file.

In either case, you can now open the file and see the text that was written. Although the examples are simple, you can modify them to suit more complex scenarios.  
  
## How to Convert Numpy Files to Text Files

When working with numerical data, `numpy` is one of the most popular libraries to manipulate arrays in Python. Sometimes, you may need to convert a `numpy` file to a text file for sharing and collaboration purposes. Here are two ways to convert a `numpy` file to a text file in Python:

The `savetxt()` function from the `Numpy` library can be used to save the data from an array to a text file. Here's how to do it:

```python
### Method 1
import numpy as np

data = np.load('file.npy') # load the Numpy file
np.savetxt('file.txt', data) # save the data from the Numpy file to a text file
```

You can also use the `tofile()` method of the array object to save the data to a text file.

```python
### Method 2
import numpy as np

data = np.load('file.npy') # load the Numpy file
data.tofile('file.txt', sep=',', format='%10.5f') # save the data to a text file
```

In the above example, the `sep` parameter specifies the separator between the data values (a comma in this case) and the `format` parameter specifies the format of the output values.
