Python provides built-in modules that allow you to work with date and time values in various formats. The datetime module is a popular one for handling date and time objects, including time zones, time differences, and time arithmetic. The module also offers a wide range of formatting options to display dates and times in different ways. Additionally, Python's time module provides functions for working with time values, such as getting the current time, measuring elapsed time, and setting timeouts. Understanding how to work with date and time values is essential for many programming tasks, including scheduling, data analysis, and database management.

## Working with Dates & Times in Python

Python has several built-in modules for working with dates and times. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:

1. `**datetime module**`: This module provides classes for working with dates and times. It includes classes such as datetime, date, time, and timedelta that can be used to represent and manipulate dates, times, and durations.

2. `**time module: This module provides functions to work with time-related functions, such as getting the current time, waiting for a certain amount of time, and converting between time representations.

3. `**calendar module: This module provides functions for working with calendars, such as getting the number of days in a month, determining the day of the week for a given date, and formatting dates in various ways.

4. `**dateutil module: This module provides additional functionality for working with dates and times, including parsing dates and times from strings, handling time zones, and performing arithmetic with dates and times.
