**Generator functions** in Python are special kinds of functions that can be used to create **iterators**. They generate a sequence of values on-the-fly as required, rather than returning a value all at once like regular functions. This makes them more memory-efficient and faster than other methods of producing iterators. 

## Introduction to Generators

Benefits of using generator functions include improved performance efficiency, better memory management, and the ability to handle large and infinite data sets.

### Example 1: Regular Python function

```python3
def power(n):
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        result.append(2**i)
    return result

print(power(5)) # Output: [1, 2, 4, 8, 16]
```

### Example 2: Python generator function 

```python3
def power(n):
    for i in range(n):
        yield 2**i

print(list(power(5))) # Output: [1, 2, 4, 8, 16]
``` 

In the second example, the generator function is used to create an **iterator** that generates each value on-the-fly as needed, rather than creating and storing a list of values in memory like the first example. This can be a much more efficient way of working with large data sets or calculations that may not need to be stored in memory all at once.  

## Syntax and Structure of Generator Functions  

It uses the `yield` keyword to return a value and temporarily suspend the function's execution. The **syntax** of a generator function in Python is **similar** to a regular function, but with the addition of the `yield` statement.

Syntax of a generator function in Python:

```python 
def count_up_to(n):
    i = 1
    while i <= n:
        yield i
        i += 1
```

In this example, the generator function `count_up_to()` generates a sequence of numbers from `1` up to a given value `n`. When called, it returns a generator object that can be iterated over to get the `next` value in the sequence.

Another example of a generator function is the `string_generator()` function that takes a string as input and returns each character of the string one at a time using the yield statement.

```python 
def string_generator(string):
    for char in string:
        yield char
```

The generator function `string_generator()` creates a new generator object that produces one character at a time from the input string. The yield statement is used to temporarily pause the execution of the function and return the current character before resuming execution.

## Understanding the `yield` Satement in Generator Functions  

Generator function in Python is a special type of Python function that can return an iterator object. These iterator objects can be used to generate a sequence of values on the fly, rather than computing them all at once and storing them in a list. The yield statement is a crucial part of generator functions and allows the function to produce a value and pause its execution temporarily.

### Example 1: Simple Generator Function in Python

```python 
def simple_generator():
    yield 'Hello'
    yield 'World'
    yield '!'
```

In this example, the `simple_generator()` function has three yield statements, which will produce three values: `Hello`, `World`, and `!`. When the function is called, it does not immediately execute its code; instead, it returns an iterator object. Each time the iterator's `__next__()` method is called, the function will execute until it hits a `yield` statement. At that point, the function will pause its execution and return the value to the caller. The next time the iterator's `__next__()` method is called, the function will resume execution where it left off and continue until it reaches the next `yield` statement or the end of the function.

### Example 2: Generator Function with Parameters in Python

```python 
def even_numbers(maximum):
    i = 0
    while i < maximum:
        if i % 2 == 0:
            yield i
        i += 1
```

In this example, the `even_numbers()` generator function takes a `maximum` parameter, indicating the maximum number of even numbers to generate. The function uses a `while` loop to iterate from 0 to `maximum` and uses an `if` statement to check whether the current number is even. If the number is even, the function yields the value. The function will continue to generate even numbers until it has met the `maximum` limit, or until the iterator's `__next__()` method is no longer called. 

Overall, generator functions in Python are a powerful tool to generate a sequence of values on the fly, which saves computational memory and offers improved performance over traditional methods of generating large sequences of data.

## Differences between Generators and Regular Functions in Python

Generator functions in Python are a special type of function that allows us to return an iterator object. The generator function returns a generator object that can be iterated upon. Regular functions, on the other hand, return a value and then exit.

Here are some differences between Python functions and generator functions:

1. **Execution:** A regular Python function runs until it reaches the end or a return statement. A generator function, on the other hand, yields a value and then goes into a suspended state until another value is requested.

2. **Memory Usage:** Regular functions can return a large output, which can consume a lot of memory. In contrast, generator functions use a minimum amount of memory because they lazily compute the values as and when needed.

Here's an example of a regular Python function:

```python 
def square_numbers(nums):
    result = []
    for i in nums:
        result.append(i * i)
    return result
```

This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of their squares.

Here's an example of a generator function in Python:

```python
def square_numbers(nums):
    for i in nums:
        yield i * i
```

This generator function also takes a list of numbers as input and generates their squares as output.

In summary, while regular Python functions are used to return a value and then exit, generator functions are intended to produce a sequence of values that can be iterated upon.  

## Common Use Cases for Generator Functions  

Common use cases for generator functions in Python include:

1. **Parsing large files or datasets** - Generator functions can be used to read in chunks of a file or dataset at a time, rather than loading the entire file into memory at once.

2. **Generating infinite sequences** - Generator functions can be used to generate infinite sequences of numbers, such as the Fibonacci sequence, without requiring the programmer to create a large list or array.

### Example: Function to Read a Large File in Chunks

```python
def read_chunks(file_path, chunk_size=1024):
    with open(file_path, "r") as f:
        while True:
            chunk = f.read(chunk_size)
            if not chunk:
                break
            yield chunk
```

The `read_chunks()` function reads a file in chunks of size `chunk_size` and yields each chunk until the end of the file is reached. This allows the programmer to process large files without loading the entire file into memory.

## Advanced Techniques for Working with Generator Functions

By utilizing the **advanced techniques** discussed below, you can **manipulate** and **optimize** the output of generator functions in your code.

### Lazy Execution

One of the primary benefits of generator functions is the **ability to delay execution on the fly** until the output is actually needed. This can significantly improve the performance of your code by avoiding the need to generate and store all output in memory.

```python3
def fibonacci(n):
    a, b = 0, 1
    for _ in range(n):
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

gen = fibonacci(10) # Does not execute any code.
for num in gen:
    print(num) # Executes code as needed.
```

### Threading with Generators

You can even **combine generators with threads** to **asynchronously** execute code, allowing for **multiple processes** to be executed simultaneously and further improving the performance of your code.

```python 
from threading import Thread
import time

def countdown(num):
    print(f"Starting countdown for {num}")
    for i in range(num, 0, -1):
        print(i)
        time.sleep(1)

def generate_counts():
    for i in range(5, 0, -1):
        yield Thread(target=countdown, args=(i,))

threads = list(generate_counts())
for thread in threads:
    thread.start()

for thread in threads:
    thread.join()
```

In this example, we create a generator function that creates multiple threads using the `Thread` module in Python. The `countdown` function is executed within each generated thread, asynchronously counting down from the specified value. By utilizing generator functions and threads together, we can create more efficient and performant code that takes advantage of multiple processors simultaneously.

## Best Practices and Tips for Writing Efficient and Effective Generator Functions  

1. **Use a generator function instead of a list comprehension or loop**, when generating large sequences of data. This is because a generator function produces values on-the-fly, while a list comprehension or loop creates the entire sequence in memory before returning it.

2. **Use the `yield` keyword instead of `return` when producing values** in a generator function. This allows the function to pause execution and return a value, without terminating the function. The function can then be resumed from where it left off later on.

3. **Use the `next()` function** to advance through the sequence generated by a generator function. This function retrieves the next value produced by the function and moves the function's execution state forward.

4. **Use the `send()` function** to send a value back into a generator function and resume its execution. This function allows a client code to pass values into a generator function, which can then use those values to produce new values. 

### Example: A Generator Function that Produces Values in a Geometric Sequence

```python3
def geometric_sequence(start, factor):
    value = start
    while True:
        yield value
        value *= factor

# Usage:
g = geometric_sequence(2, 3)
print(next(g))  # Prints 2
print(next(g))  # Prints 6
print(next(g))  # Prints 18
print(next(g))  # Prints 54
print(next(g))  # Prints 162
# ...

```

In example, the generator function produces an infinite sequence of values. However, the `yield` keyword allows the function to **produce values on-demand**, and the client code can consume these values one at a time, **without storing the entire sequence in memory**.
