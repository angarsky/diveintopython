Python is a popular programming language that provides various operations and methods for working with data and performing various tasks. Let's review the most popular which relate to all vriable types.

## Type Definition

There are several ways to check the type of a variable in Python.

### Function `type()`

This built-in `type()` function returns the data type of a variable, it is the equivalent of `typeof` in other programming languages.

Here's an example:

```python
x = 23
print(type(x))   # Output: <class 'int'>

y = 3.14
print(type(y))   # Output: <class 'float'>

z = "Hello, friend!"
print(type(z))   # Output: <class 'str'>

w = True
print(type(w))   # Output: <class 'bool'>
```

In this example, the `type()` function is used to determine the type of variables `x`, `y`, `z`, and `w`. The output shows the class of the variable.
