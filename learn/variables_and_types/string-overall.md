Previously we've touched the topic of operations with variables. In this part we will dive into most common operations and methods with strings. This is not the whole list of possible string manipulations.

## String Variable Declaration

You can declare a string variable by assigning a string value to a variable name using the equals sign `=`. Here's an example:

```python
my_string = "Hello, world!"
```

In this example, we have declared a string variable called `my_string` and assigned it the value `"Hello, world!"`. Note that the string value is enclosed in quotation marks.

You can also declare an empty string variable by assigning an empty string value to a variable name, like this:

```python
my_string = ""
```

In this case, we have declared a string variable called `my_string` and assigned it an empty string value.
