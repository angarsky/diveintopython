a substring is a sequence of characters that is part of a larger string. It is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string, which can be extracted or manipulated independently.

For example, in the string "Hello, World!", the substrings "Hello", "World", and "!" are all substrings of the original string.

Substrings in Python can be extracted using slicing or the find() method. Slicing is done using the colon (:) operator, and the find() method returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified substring within the string.
