This program simply prints the message `Hello, World!` to the screen. It's a basic example of how to use the `print()` function in Python.

## How to install 

To get started with Python, installing it on your machine is the first step. In [this guide](/learn/install.md), we will explore how to install Python using various methods.  
  
## Variables & Types  

One of the fundamental concepts to grasp when learning Python is variables and types. Understanding these concepts is critical to writing efficient and effective Python code that interfaces with a wide range of data types and structures. [This article](/learn/variables.md) will introduce you to the basics of Python variables and types, exploring how they work and their importance in the world of programming.  
  
## Arrays  

Arrays in Python is a fundamental concept for managing and storing a collection of values. Arrays are not only useful but also an essential data structure for building algorithms and solving programming problems. In this article, we will dive deeper into what arrays are in Python, exploring how to create, manipulate, and use them efficiently. 
  
## Functions  

One of the key aspects of Python is the ability to define and execute [functions](/learn/functions.md), which are reusable blocks of code that can perform specific tasks. In this article, we will explore the basics of functions in Python, including how to define and call them, pass arguments, and return values. We will also discuss some advanced concepts, such as lambda functions and decorators, that can enhance your coding skills and make your programs more efficient.  
  
## Simple statements, expressions and operators  

One of the features that contribute to this characteristic is the use of [simple statements, expressions, and operators](/learn/statements.md) in Python. In this article, we will explore the basics of it's using and how they can help streamline your programming process.  
  
## Loops  

Loops in Python are incredibly powerful tools that allow programmers to automate recurring tasks. Using statements such as `for` and `while`, programmers can iterate through a list of data or create a loop that continues until a certain condition is met. In [this article](/learn/loops.md), we will dive deeper into the world of loops in Python and explore their many uses.
