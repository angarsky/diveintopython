Python set operations and methods allow you to manipulate sets of unique and unordered elements efficiently. With set operations, you can perform common tasks such as union, intersection, and difference. Set methods, on the other hand, provide functionality for adding, removing, and checking for the presence of elements in a set. Understanding these operations and methods is crucial for effectively working with sets in Python.
