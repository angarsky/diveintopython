Python provides several built-in collection types to store and manipulate data. Some of the commonly used collection types in Python are:

Lists: A list is an ordered collection of items, which can be of any data type such as integers, strings, or other objects. Lists are mutable, which means you can modify them by adding or removing elements.
Tuples: A tuple is similar to a list, but it is immutable, meaning you cannot modify its contents after creation. Tuples are typically used to represent a collection of related values.
Sets: A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are useful for tasks like eliminating duplicate values or testing whether two lists have any elements in common.
Dictionaries: A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key in the dictionary maps to a unique value. Dictionaries are useful for tasks like storing data in a lookup table or mapping one set of values to another.
Arrays: An array is a collection of items of the same data type. Arrays are useful when you need to store and manipulate large amounts of data efficiently.
Deques: A deque (short for "double-ended queue") is a data structure that allows you to add and remove elements from both ends efficiently. Deques are useful for implementing algorithms like breadth-first search or maintaining a sliding window over a sequence of data.
There are also other less commonly used collection types in Python, such as namedtuples, default dictionaries, and heaps, which are specialized versions of the basic collection types listed above.
