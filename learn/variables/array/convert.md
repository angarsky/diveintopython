In Python, converting between lists and arrays is a common task when dealing with numerical data. The process of converting from a list to an array allows us to take advantage of efficient numerical computations and operations provided by libraries like NumPy. By using the numpy.array() function, we can effortlessly convert a list to an array. On the other hand, if we want to convert an array back to a list, we can use the tolist() method available in NumPy. These conversions provide flexibility and enable seamless integration between Python's built-in lists and powerful array operations.
