Python lists are versatile and commonly used data structures that allow you to store collections of elements, including numbers, strings, and even other lists. They support various basic operations and methods that enable you to manipulate and work with the list elements easily. Some of the commonly used operations and methods for lists include indexing, slicing, appending, inserting, deleting, sorting, and searching for elements. Let's review the basic list methods and functions step by step.

## Defining an Index of an Element

A list is an ordered collection of elements that can be of any type. Each element in a list has a unique index, which represents its position in the list. List indexes start at 0, which means that the first element in a list has an index of 0, the second element has an index of 1, and so on.

There is no direct method called `indexof()` for finding the index of an element in a list. However, you can use the `index()` method that is built into Python lists to achieve the same result.

The `index()` method takes an element as an argument and returns the index of the first occurrence of that element in the list. For example, let's say you have a list of strings:

```python
my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'banana', 'date']
```

You can find the index of the first occurrence of the element 'banana' using the `index()` method like this:

```python
index_of_banana = my_list.index('banana')   # 1
```

The index() method raises a `ValueError` if the element is not found in the list.

## List Comprehension in Python

List comprehension is a concise way to create a new list in Python by applying an expression to each element of an existing list or iterable. The basic syntax of a list comprehension is:

```python
new_list = [expression(item) for item in iterable if condition]
```

Where:

- `expression` is an operation that will be applied to each element of the iterable.
- `item` is the variable that represents each element of the iterable.
- `iterable` is a sequence of elements, such as a list or a range.
- `condition` is an optional expression that filters the elements based on a condition.

For example, to create a new list with the squares of the numbers from 1 to 5, you can use a list comprehension like this:

```python
squares = [x**2 for x in range(1, 6)]
print(squares)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

You can also use an `if` statement to filter the elements based on a condition. For example, to create a new list with the even numbers from 1 to 10, you can use a list comprehension like this:

```python
evens = [x for x in range(1, 11) if x % 2 == 0]
print(evens)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

## Determining the Length of a List

In Python, you can get the length of a list by using the built-in `len()` function.

Here's an example:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
length = len(my_list)
print(length)  # Output: 5
```

## List Reversing

To reverse a list in Python, you can use the built-in `reverse()` method or slicing notation. Here are examples of both:

Using the `reverse()` method:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_list.reverse()
print(my_list) # Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

Using slicing notation:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
reversed_list = my_list[::-1]
print(reversed_list) # Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

## Counting the Elements of a List

To count the number of elements in a list in Python, you can use the `len()` function. Here's an example of list size definition:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
count = len(my_list)
print(count) # Output: 5
```

You can also use the `len()` function to check if a Python list is empty, as there is no `isEmpty()` method in Python.

Here's an example using checking:

```python
my_list = []
if len(my_list) == 0:
    print("The list is empty")
else:
    print("The list is not empty")
```

## List Filtering in Python

In Python, you can use the `filter()` function to filter a list, i.e. to create a new list that contains only the elements from an existing list that satisfy a certain condition.

The `filter()` function takes two arguments: a function and an iterable. The function should return True or False for each element in the iterable. The `filter()` function then returns a new iterable that contains only the elements for which the function returned True.

Here's an example that filters a list of numbers to only include the even ones:

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]

def is_even(num):
    return num % 2 == 0

even_numbers = list(filter(is_even, numbers))
print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
