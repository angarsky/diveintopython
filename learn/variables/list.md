A list in Python is a collection of values or items that are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicates. Lists are one of the most commonly used data structures in Python.

## Creating a List in Python

Here's an example of how to create a list in Python:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

As you can see, creation of list is is a fairly simple process. To create an empty list, you can simply use the following syntax:

```python
my_list = []
```

Let's review some basic operations that can be performed on lists in Python.

## Accessing Items In a List Using an Index

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(my_list[0]) # Output: 1
```

## Changing an Item In a List

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
my_list[0] = 0
print(my_list) # Output: [0, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
