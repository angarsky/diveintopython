Python supports several numeric data types that are used for various mathematical operations in programming. These data types include integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers. Understanding these data types and their characteristics is essential for any programmer who wants to work with numeric data in Python.

## Number Types in Python

In Python, there are several number types that can be used for different purposes. The most common number types in Python are:

- Integer number (int): This is a whole number without any decimal point. For example, 1, 2, 3, etc. are integers.
- Float number: This is a decimal number. For example, 1.2, 3.14159, etc. are floats.
- Complex number: This is a number with a real and imaginary part. For example, 1 + 2j, 3.14 - 4j, etc. are complex numbers.

Here are some examples of how to define these number types in Python:

```python
# Integer
x = 5
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>

# Float
y = 3.14
print(type(y))  # Output: <class 'float'>

# Complex
z = 2 + 3j
print(type(z))  # Output: <class 'complex'>
```

## The `isinstance()` Function

To check whether a variable is a number in Python, you can use the `isinstance()` function to check if the variable belongs to the int, float or complex data type. Here's an example:

```python
x = 10
y = 3.14
z = 2 + 3j

print(isinstance(x, (int, float, complex)))  # Output: True
print(isinstance(y, (int, float, complex)))  # Output: True
print(isinstance(z, (int, float, complex)))  # Output: True
print(isinstance('hello', (int, float, complex)))  # Output: False
```

## Rounding a Number in Python

You can round a number using the built-in `round()` function. The `round()` function takes two arguments: the number to be rounded and the number of decimal places to round to.

Here's an example:

```python
x = 3.14159
rounded_x = round(x, 2)
print(rounded_x) # Output: 3.14
```

Note that if the number to be rounded ends in 5, the `round()` function will round to the nearest even number. This is known as "bankers rounding". For example:

```python
x = 2.5
rounded_x = round(x)
print(rounded_x) # Output: 2
```

## Number Formatting

In Python, there are several ways to format numbers. Here are some examples:

- Using the built-in `format()` function:

```python
x = 3.14159
print("{:.2f}".format(x))  # Output: 3.14
```
The `"{:.2f}"` string inside the `format()` function tells Python to format the number as a float with 2 decimal places.

- Using f-strings (Python 3.6 and above):

```python
x = 3.14159
print(f"{x:.2f}")  # Output: 3.14
```
The `f` before the string indicates that it is an f-string, and the `"{x:.2f}"` inside the string tells Python to format the value of `x` as a float with 2 decimal places.

- Using the % operator:

```python
x = 3.14159
print("%.2f" % x)  # Output: 3.14
```

The `%.2f` string inside the `%` operator tells Python to format the number as a float with 2 decimal places.

## Checking If a String Is a Number

You can check if a string is a number in Python using various methods. Here are a few examples:

- Using `isnumeric()` method:

```python
my_string = "123"
if my_string.isnumeric():
    print("String is a number")
else:
    print("String is not a number") # Output: String is a number

- Using `isdigit()` method:

```python
my_string = "456"
if my_string.isdigit():
    print("String is a number")
else:
    print("String is not a number") # Output: String is a number
 ```

- Using try-except block to convert string to float:

```python
my_string = "789.12"
try:
    float(my_string)
    print("String is a number")
except ValueError:
    print("String is not a number") # Output: String is a number
```

Note that if the string contains a non-numeric character, the first two methods will return `False` and the third method will raise a `ValueError`.
