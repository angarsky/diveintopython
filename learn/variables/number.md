Python supports several numeric data types that are used for various mathematical operations in programming. These data types include integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers. Understanding these data types and their characteristics is essential for any programmer who wants to work with numeric data in Python.

## Number Types in Python

In Python, there are several number types that can be used for different purposes. The most common number types in Python are:

- **Integer number** (int): This is a whole number without any decimal point. For example, `1`, `2`, `3`, etc. are integers.
- **Float number**: This is a decimal number. For example, `1.2`, `3.14159`, etc. are floats.
- **Complex number**: This is a number with a real and imaginary part. For example, `1 + 2j`, `3.14 - 4j`, etc. are complex numbers.

Here are some examples of how to define these number types in Python:

```python
# Integer
x = 5
print(type(x))  # Output: <class 'int'>

# Float
y = 3.14
print(type(y))  # Output: <class 'float'>

# Complex
z = 2 + 3j
print(type(z))  # Output: <class 'complex'>
```

## The `isinstance()` Function

To check whether a variable is a number in Python, you can use the `isinstance()` function to check if the variable belongs to the int, float or complex data type. Here's an example:

```python3
x = 10
y = 3.14
z = 2 + 3j

print(isinstance(x, (int, float, complex)))  # Output: True
print(isinstance(y, (int, float, complex)))  # Output: True
print(isinstance(z, (int, float, complex)))  # Output: True
print(isinstance('hello', (int, float, complex)))  # Output: False
```

## Rounding a Number in Python

You can round a number using the built-in `round()` function. The `round()` function takes two arguments: the number to be rounded and the number of decimal places to round to.

Here's an example:

```python3
x = 3.14159
rounded_x = round(x, 2)
print(rounded_x) # Output: 3.14
```

Note that if the number to be rounded ends in 5, the `round()` function will round to the nearest even number. This is known as "bankers rounding". For example:

```python
x = 2.5
rounded_x = round(x)
print(rounded_x) # Output: 2
```

## Number Formatting

In Python, there are several ways to format numbers. Here are some examples:

### Using the built-in `format()` function

```python3
x = 3.14159
print("{:.2f}".format(x))  # Output: 3.14
```
The `"{:.2f}"` string inside the `format()` function tells Python to format the number as a float with 2 decimal places.

### Using f-strings (Python 3.6 and above)

```python
x = 3.14159
print(f"{x:.2f}")  # Output: 3.14
```
The `f` before the string indicates that it is an f-string, and the `"{x:.2f}"` inside the string tells Python to format the value of `x` as a float with 2 decimal places.

### Using the `%` operator

```python3
x = 3.14159
print("%.2f" % x)  # Output: 3.14
```

The `%.2f` string inside the `%` operator tells Python to format the number as a float with 2 decimal places.

## Checking If a String Is a Number

You can check if a string is a number in Python using various methods. Here are a few examples:

### Using `isnumeric()` method

```python
my_string = "123"
if my_string.isnumeric():
    print("String is a number")
else:
    print("String is not a number") # Output: String is a number
```
    
### Using `isdigit()` method

```python
my_string = "456"
if my_string.isdigit():
    print("String is a number")
else:
    print("String is not a number") # Output: String is a number
 ```

### Using try-except block to convert string to float

```python
my_string = "789.12"
try:
    float(my_string)
    print("String is a number")
except ValueError:
    print("String is not a number") # Output: String is a number
```

> Note that if the string contains a non-numeric character, the first two methods will return `False` and the third method will raise a `ValueError`.

## Check If a Number is Whole

You can use the modulo operator `%` to check if a number is whole or not. If the result of dividing the number by 1 is equal to 0, then the number is a whole number.

Here's an example:

```python
num = 5.0  # the number you want to check

if num % 1 == 0:
    print("The number is whole.")
else:
    print("The number is not whole.") # Output: "The number is whole."
 ``` 
 
## Generating a Random Number

To get a random number in Python, you can use the random module. Here's an example of how to generate a random integer between 0 and 10:

```python
import random

random_number = random.randint(0, 10)
print(random_number)
```

This will print a random integer between 0 and 10 (inclusive) each time you run the script. If you want to generate a random floating-point number, you can use the `random.uniform()` function instead:

```python
import random

random_number = random.uniform(0, 1)
print(random_number)
```

## Squaring a Number in Python

Let's see how to square a number in Python.
The first method is using the exponent operator `**`. Here is an example:

```python
x = 5
squared = x ** 2
print(squared) # Output: 25
```

Alternatively, you can also use the `pow()` function to calculate the square of a number. Here is an example:

```python
x = 5
squared = pow(x, 2)
print(squared)
```

## Negating a Number

You can negate a number by using the `-` (minus) operator.

Here's an example:

```python
number = 10
negated_number = -number
print(negated_number) # Output: -10
```

## Prime Number

A prime number is a positive integer greater than 1 that has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself. In Python, you can check if a number is prime by testing whether it is divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

Here's an example of a function that checks whether a number is prime or not:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

This function takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is prime, and `False` otherwise.

The function first checks whether `n` is less than or equal to 1, which is not a prime number by definition. If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the function returns `False`.

If `n` is greater than 1, the function checks whether it is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any number in this range, it is not prime and the function returns `False`. Otherwise, `n` is prime and the function returns `True`.

Here's an example of how to use the `is_prime` function:

```python
print(is_prime(7)) # True
print(is_prime(15)) # False
print(is_prime(23)) # True
print(is_prime(1)) # False
```

Output:

```python
True
False
True
False
```

In this example, we called the `is_prime` function with different input values and printed the output.

## Euler's Number in Python

Euler's number, also known as the mathematical constant `e`, is a mathematical constant that is approximately equal to 2.71828. In Python, you can calculate Euler's number using the `math` module.

Here's an example of how to calculate Euler's number:

```python3
import math

e = math.e

print(e) # Output: 2.718281828459045
```

## Extracting Number from String

To extract a number from a string in Python, you can use regular expressions with the `re` module. Here's an example:

```python3
import re

string = "The price is $12.34"

number = re.findall(r'\d+\.\d+', string)[0]

print(number) # Output: 12.34
```

In this example, we first imported the `re` module, which provides support for regular expressions. We then defined a `string` variable string that contains a sentence with a number.

To extract the number from the string, we used the `re.findall` function with a regular expression pattern `\d+\.\d+`. This pattern matches one or more digits `\d+` followed by a dot `\.` followed by one or more digits `\d+`. The resulting match is a string that represents the number in the sentence.

Since `re.findall` returns a list of matches, we accessed the first element `[0]` of the list to get the number as a string.

If you need to convert the extracted number from a string to a numerical value, you can use the float or int function:

```python
number = float(number)
print(number) # Output: 12.34
```

## Digits of a Number

To find the digits of a number in Python, you can convert the number to a string and then iterate over the string to extract each digit. Here's an example:

```python3
num = 12345

# Convert number to string
num_str = str(num)

# Iterate over string and print each digit
for digit in num_str:
    print(digit)
```
