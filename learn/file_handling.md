Python has a variety of built-in functions and libraries that make working with files a breeze, and in this article, we'll explore the different techniques and best practices for handling files in Python.   
  
## How to Open Files in Python

With Python, you can easily read and write files to the system. To read a file in Python, you can use the `open()` function.

### Reading a File

In Python, you can read a file using the `open()` function. The following code example demonstrates how to read a file in Python:

```python
file = open('example.txt', 'r')
data = file.read()
print(data)
```

### Reading a File Line-By-Line

Sometimes, you may want to read a file line-by-line. To do that, you can use a `for` loop to loop through the file line-by-line. The following code demonstrates how to read a file line-by-line in Python:

```python
file = open('example.txt', 'r')
for line in file:
    print(line)
```

### Handling the `No such file or directory` Error

It's not uncommon to encounter a `No such file or directory` error when working with files in Python. To handle this error, you can use a `try` and `except` block to catch the error and handle it accordingly. The following code demonstrates how to handle a `No such file or directory` error in Python:

```python3
try:
    file = open('example.txt', 'r')
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found!")
```

## Different Modes for a File Handling in Python  

In Python, there are several modes for file handling (file open modes) including:

- **Read mode ('r')**: This mode is used to read an existing file. 

- **Write mode ('w')**: This mode is used to write to a file. It will create a new file if the file does not exist, and overwrite the file if it does exist.

- **Append mode ('a')**: This mode is used to add new data to the end of an existing file (append to a file). If the file does not exist, a new file will be created.

- **Binary mode ('b')**: This mode is used to read or write binary data, like images or audio files.

### Open a file in the write mode

```python
file = open('example.txt', 'w')

# Write to the file
file.write('Hello, World!')

# Close the file
file.close()
```

In this example, we first open a file named `example.txt` in write mode. We write the string `'Hello, World!'` to the file and then close it.

### Open a file in the read mode

```python
file = open('example.txt', 'r')

# Read the file contents
content = file.read()

# Print the contents
print(content)

# Close the file
file.close()
```

In this example, we open the same file, `example.txt`, but this time in read mode. We read the contents of the file using the `read()` method, save it to a variable named `content`, and then print the contents to the console. Finally, we `close()` the file.

## File operations  

Python provides important modules like `os` and `shutil` to perform file operations such as deleting, renaming, copying, and moving files. 

### File Deleting

You can use the `os.remove()` method to delete a file in Python. The following code snippet shows how remove file named `example.txt`.

```python
import os

os.remove("example.txt")
```

### File Renaming

You can use the `os.rename()` method to rename a file in Python. The following code snippet shows how to rename the file named `example.txt` to `new_example.txt`.

```python
import os

os.rename("example.txt", "new_example.txt")
```

### File Copying

You can use the `shutil.copy()` method to copy a file in Python. The following code snippet shows how to copy the file named `example.txt` to a new file named `new_example.txt`.

```python
import shutil

shutil.copy("example.txt", "new_example.txt")
```

### File Moving

You can use the `shutil.move()` method to move a file in Python. The following code snippet shows how to move the file named `example.txt` to a new location named `new_folder`.

```python
import shutil

shutil.move("example.txt", "/path/to/new_folder/example.txt")
```  
  
## File Methods in Python

When working with files in Python, there are several built-in methods that enable you to read, write, and manipulate file contents. These methods provide flexible options for file handling. Here's a guide to some commonly used Python file methods:

### How to Read a File

The `read()` method reads the entire contents of a file and returns them as a string. On the other hand, the `readline()` method reads a single line from the file. It returns the line as a string and moves the file pointer to the next line.

```python
file = open("example.txt", "w")
content = file.read()
line = file.readline()
file.close()
```

### How to Write to file 

The `write()` method is used to write data to a file. It takes a string as an argument and writes it to the file. Alternatively, the `writelines()` method allows you to write multiple lines to a file by providing a list of strings.

```python
file = open("example.txt", "w")
file.write("Hello, World!")
lines = ["Line 1", "Line 2", "Line 3"]
file.writelines(lines)
file.close()
```

### How to Close a File

The `close()` method is essential for proper file handling. It closes the file and releases any system resources associated with it. It is crucial to close the file after performing operations on it to avoid potential issues.

```python
file = open("example.txt", "w")
# Perform operations on the file
file.close()
```

These are just a few examples of Python file methods that enable you to read, write, and manipulate files. It's important to handle exceptions and close files properly to ensure efficient file management and resource utilization. By utilizing these file methods effectively, you can handle file operations with ease in your Python programs.

## File Size Operations

To get the size of a file in Python, you can use various methods provided by the Python standard library. Here are two examples that demonstrate how to retrieve the size of a file using different approaches.

### How to get a File Size

The `os.path` module provides a convenient method, `getsize()`, to retrieve the size of a file in bytes.

```python3
import os

file_path = "example.txt"

try:
    file_size = os.path.getsize(file_path)
    print("File size:", file_size, "bytes")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found.")
```

In this example, we use the `getsize()` function from the `os.path` module to obtain the size of the file specified by `file_path`. If the file is found, the size is printed in bytes. If the file is not found, a `FileNotFoundError` is raised.

### Get a File Size with the `os.stat` Function

Another way to retrieve the size of a file is by using the `os.stat()` function, which returns a named tuple containing file attributes, including the file size.

```python3
import os

file_path = "example.txt"

try:
    file_stats = os.stat(file_path)
    file_size = file_stats.st_size
    print("File size:", file_size, "bytes")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found.")
```

In this example, we call `os.stat()` to obtain the file attributes, including the size, which is accessed using the `st_size` attribute of the returned named tuple.

By using these approaches, you can easily retrieve the size of a file in Python. Remember to handle exceptions, such as `FileNotFoundError`, to account for cases where the file does not exist.

## Operations with a File Extension

When working with files in Python, you may often need to extract the file extension to determine the type of file you're dealing with. Python provides several ways to obtain the file extension from a file name or path. 

```python
import os

filename = "example.txt"
extension = os.path.splitext(filename)[1]

print("File Extension:", extension)
```

In this example, we use the `os.path` module, specifically the `splitext()` function, to separate the file extension from the given file name. It returns a tuple containing the base name and the extension, and we extract the `extension` using indexing.

## How to Check if a File Exists with Python  

To check if a file exists, you can use the built-in [os](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html) module which provides functionality for interacting with the operating system. 

```python3
import os

# Define the path of the file to check
file_path = "/path/to/file"

# Check if the file exists
if os.path.exists(file_path):
    print("File exists!")
else:
    print("File does not exist.")
```

In this example, we first `import` the `os` module and then define the `file_path` variable with the path to the file we want to check. The `os.path.exists()` function is used to check if the file exists, and if so, we `print` a message indicating that the file exists. If the file does not exist, we `print` a message indicating that it does not exist.

```python
import os

# Define the path of the file to check
file_path = "/path/to/file"

try:
    # Check if the file exists
    with open(file_path) as f:
        print("File exists!")
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File does not exist.")
```

In this example, we use a `try` and `except` block to catch the `FileNotFoundError` exception that is raised if the file does not exist. We try to open the file: `with open(file_path) as f:` and if the file exists, we `print` a message indicating that the file exists. If the file does not exist, we catch the `FileNotFoundError` exception and `print` a message indicating that the file does not exist.

By using one of these two code examples, you can easily check if a file exists in Python and take the appropriate action depending on the result.  
  
## How to Create a Simple File  

To create a file in Python, use the built-in `open()` function. You can specify the file name and the mode in which you want to open the file (read, write, or append). 

To print to a file in Python, you can use the `print()` function with the `file` parameter:

```python
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
  print("Hello, World!", file=file)
```

This code creates a new file named `example.txt` in write mode, and writes the string `Hello, World!` to the file.

To write to a file in Python, you can use the `.write()` method:

```python
with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
  file.write("Hello, World!")
```

This code creates a new file named `example.txt` in write mode, and writes the string `Hello, World!` to the file using the `write()` method. 

Remember to close the file after you are done writing. Using the `with` statement handles this automatically.
