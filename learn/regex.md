print("Email Address Found:", match)
```

### Example: Validate Phone Number

```python
import re

def validate_phone_number(number):
    if re.match(r'^\+?1?\d{9,15}$', number):
        return True
    return False

number = "+1234567890"
print("Is Valid Phone Number:", validate_phone_number(number))
```

Exploring the capabilities of regular expressions in Python opens up a new dimension of possibilities for text processing and data manipulation. Whether it's through online platforms or hands-on coding, mastering `regex` is a valuable skill in any programmer's toolkit.  

## Key Features of Python Regex Library

- **Regex in Python** helps in pattern matching, searching, and complex text manipulation.
- **Python regex word boundary** (`\b`) feature allows precise searches by marking the start or end of a word, enhancing the accuracy of your text processing tasks.

### Example: the `findall()` Usage

In this example, we use `regex` to find occurrences of a specific word in a text, demonstrating the use of the python regex word boundary.

```python
import re

text = "Python is powerful. Python is easy to learn."
pattern = r'\bPython\b'

matches = re.findall(pattern, text)
print("Occurrences of 'Python':", len(matches))
```

### Example: Validate Email

Here, we validate an `email` address using a regular expression, showcasing the versatility of regex in Python.

```python
import re

def validate_email(email):
    pattern = r'^[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+\.\w+$'
    if re.match(pattern, email):
        return True
    return False

email = "example@example.com"
print("Is the email valid?", validate_email(email))
```
  
## Regex matcher  

Key functions in the Python `re` module are `match` and `search`, each serving a distinct purpose in regex matching.

### Match vs. Search

- **python match regex**: The `re.match()` function checks for a match only at the beginning of the string. If the pattern is not at the start, it returns None.
- **python regex search**: Contrary to match, `re.search()` scans the entire string looking for a match anywhere in the text.

Here are two examples demonstrating the use of `re.match()` and `re.search()` in Python.

### Example: Using `re.match()`

```python
import re

pattern = r"Python"
text = "Learning Python with regex"

match = re.match(pattern, text)

if match:
    print("Match found:", match.group())
else:
    print("No match found")
```

In this scenario, since Python is not at the beginning, `re.match()` will return `No match found`.

### Example: Using `re.search()`

```python
import re

pattern = r"Python"
text = "Learning Python with regex"

search = re.search(pattern, text)

if search:
    print("Match found:", search.group())
else:
    print("No match found")
```

Here, `re.search()` scans the entire string and successfully finds Python, returning `Match found: Python`.

Understanding the difference between match and `search` in Python regex matching is crucial for effectively manipulating and searching strings in Python applications.  
  
## Regex Replace  

Are you looking to master the art of **Python Regex Replace**? This powerful technique allows you to search for patterns within strings and replace them with desired text, making data manipulation smoother than ever. Whether you're working with data cleaning, processing, or even web scraping, understanding how to utilize **Python string replace regex** can significantly enhance your coding efficiency. Here's a concise guide with practical examples to get you started:

## Using `re.sub()` for Python Regex Replace All

The `re` module in Python provides a method called `sub()` which stands for substitute. It's the cornerstone for performing **python replaceall regex** operations. The syntax is straightforward: `re.sub(pattern, replacement, string)`. This method searches for the pattern in the given string and replaces it with the replacement string.

### Example: Simple Word Replacement

```python
import re

text = "Hello World! Welcome to the World of Python."
new_text = re.sub(r"World", "Universe", text)
print(new_text)
```

Output: `Hello Universe! Welcome to the Universe of Python.`

This example demonstrates how to replace all instances of `World` with `Universe` in the given string.

### Example: Removing Punctuation

```python
import re

text = "Hello, World! How are you today?"
clean_text = re.sub(r"[,!.?]", "", text)
print(clean_text)
```

Output: `Hello World How are you today`

Here, we efficiently remove all common punctuation marks from our string, showcasing the utility of `re.sub()` for text cleaning purposes.

Mastering **Python string replace regex** with `re.sub()` function offers a flexible and powerful way to manipulate strings in Python. Its ability to search and replace patterns makes it an invaluable tool for anyone looking to perform sophisticated text processing tasks effortlessly.

## RegEx `split()` Method  

Discover how to efficiently split strings in Python using regular expressions (regex). The Python regex split methods allow for advanced string splitting capabilities, beyond what the basic `split()` function offers. Mastering python regex split, python split on regex, or python split by regex techniques can elevate your string manipulation skills in Python programming.

To use Python regex split, you first need to `import` the `re` module which contains the `split` method. This powerful method allows you to split a string by the occurrences of a pattern defined by regex.

### Example: Splitting the String by Comma Followed by a Space

```python
import re

# Example string
text = "Words, separated, by, commas."
# Splitting the string by comma followed by a space
words = re.split(r',\s', text)

print(words)
# Output: ['Words', 'separated', 'by', 'commas.']
```

In this example, `\s` is a regex that matches any whitespace character. Combined with `,`, it effectively splits the string wherever a comma followed by a space is found.

### Example: Splitting by Multiple Delimiters

```python
import re

# Example string with multiple delimiters
text = "Words; separated by, different. delimiters!"
# Splitting by multiple delimiters: semicolon, comma, and period
words = re.split(r'[;,.]\s', text)

print(words)
# Output: ['Words', 'separated by', 'different', 'delimiters!']
```

Here, `[;,.]` signifies a character set consisting of a semicolon, comma, and period. This allows the split to occur on any of these characters followed by a space, showcasing the versatility of using python split by regex for more complex string manipulation tasks.

By incorporating Python regex split into your projects, you unlock a higher level of string processing capability, enabling more precise and varied data parsing and manipulation techniques.  
  
## How to Use `re.findall()`  

Discovering all occurrences that match a pattern in a string is a common task in data processing and analysis. Python, with its rich library ecosystem, offers a straightforward approach to this through the `re` module, especially when working with regular expressions (regex). In this post, we'll explore how to use Python regex functions to find all matches, focusing on common tasks like email extraction.

The `re.findall()` function in Python is designed for retrieving all non-overlapping matches of a pattern in a string, returning them as a list. This capability is incredibly useful for tasks that require pattern matching like extracting email addresses from a text.

### Key Methods

- `re.findall(pattern, string, flags=0)`: Searches the string for all matches of the pattern and returns them as a list.

For a more practical application, let's use `re.findall()` to extract email addresses from a text:

```python
import re

text = "For more information, contact us at info@example.com or support@example.org."
email_pattern = r'[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}'

emails = re.findall(email_pattern, text)
print(emails)
# Output: ['info@example.com', 'support@example.org']
```

## RegEx: `sub()` and `search()` methods

In Python, regex (regular expressions) are utilized for string searching and manipulation. Two powerful functions in this domain are `regex.sub()` and `regex.search()`. By mastering these, you can efficiently perform **Python regex substitution** and search operations in your text processing tasks.

### Python Regex Sub re.sub()

The `re.sub()` function in Python is used for **Python regex substitution**. It replaces occurrences of a pattern in a string with a specified replacement. It's particularly useful when you want to modify strings in a sophisticated manner, including using **Python regex sub capture group**s to manipulate specific parts of the matched text.

```python
import re

text = "2024 is the year of code"
# Replace all instances of a digit sequence with 'XXXX'
result = re.sub(r'\d+', 'XXXX', text)
print(result)  # Output: XXXX is the year of code
```

### Regex Search in Python

The `regex.search()` function in Python scans a string for the first location where a specified regex pattern is found. It returns a match object if a match is found and `None` if no match is found. This is perfect for checking the presence of patterns in strings.

```python
import re

text = "Reach me at email@example.com"
# Search for an email pattern
match = re.search(r'[\w\.-]+@[\w\.-]+', text)
if match:
    print("Email found:", match.group())  # Output: Email found: email@example.com
else:
    print("No email found.")
```

By incorporating `regex.search()` techniques alongside **regex sub capture group** functionality, you can achieve comprehensive text analysis and manipulation. These tools are vital for data cleaning, parsing, and more sophisticated text processing tasks.
