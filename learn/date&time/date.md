The Python time module is a powerful tool for working with time-related operations in Python. It provides functions for measuring time intervals, formatting and parsing time and date strings, and handling time zones. With the time module, you can easily work with time and date values, and perform a wide range of time-related operations in your Python code. Whether you need to measure the execution time of your code or work with date and time values, the time module has got you covered.

## Python `time.sleep()` Function

`time.sleep()` is a Python function that suspends the execution of the current thread for a specified number of seconds.

The syntax of `time.sleep()` is:

```python
import time

time.sleep(seconds)
```

where `seconds` is the number of seconds for which the thread should be suspended.

## `time.time()` Function in Python

In Python, `time.time()` is a function that returns the current time in seconds since the Epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC) as a floating-point number.

Here's an example of how to use `time.time()` function for time measuring in Python:

```python
import time

start_time = time.time()

# do some time-consuming task here

end_time = time.time()

elapsed_time = end_time - start_time

print(f"The task took {elapsed_time:.2f} seconds to complete.")
```

In this example, `start_time` and `end_time` are obtained by calling `time.time()` at the beginning and end of the time-consuming task, respectively. The difference between the two times gives the elapsed time, which is then printed out. The elapsed time is formatted as a string with two decimal places using f-strings. This way you can measure execution time of any code snippet.
