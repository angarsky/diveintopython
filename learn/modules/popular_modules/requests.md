## The Requests Module  

The Requests module in Python is an HTTP library that allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests using Python. However, if you encounter the error `no module named requests` when trying to use the `requests` module in Python, it means that the module is not installed or is not accessible in your environment.

To install the [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) module, you can simply run the following command in your terminal:

```shell
pip install requests
```

Once youâ€™ve installed the Requests library, you can use it to send requests to web servers via Python. Below is a simple code example that demonstrates how to use the Requests module to request `data` from a website:

```python
import requests

response = requests.get('https://www.example.com')
print(response.text)
```

In this example, we `import` the Requests module and use the `requests.get` method to send a GET request to the website specified in the parameter. The `response.text` attribute contains the `data` returned by the website, which we `print` to the console.

Here's another example showing how to send a POST request with some data:

```python
import requests

data = {'key': 'value'}
response = requests.post('https://www.example.com', data=data)
print(response.text)
```

In this example, we use the `requests.post` method to send a POST request to the website specified in the parameter. We also pass in some `data` as a dictionary, which will be sent as form `data` with the request. The `response.text` attribute contains the `data` returned by the website, which we `print` to the console.
