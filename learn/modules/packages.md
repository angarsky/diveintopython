With a rich set of libraries and frameworks, Python enables developers to write efficient and maintainable code easily. In this headline package, we will explore some of the most important features of Python and how it can be used to solve real-world problems.

## How to Install Package

To install a specific version of a Python package, you can use the pip package manager. First, open your command prompt or terminal and execute the following command:

```shell
pip install package_name==desired_version
```

Replace `package_name` with the name of the package you want to install and `desired_version` with the specific version number you wish to install.

Alternatively, if the package is available on GitHub, you can install it directly using pip by specifying the GitHub repository URL. Run the following command in your command prompt or terminal:

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/username/repository.git
```

Replace `username/repository` with the GitHub username and repository name of the package you want to install.

### Installing a specific version of the requests package:

```shell
pip install requests==2.23.0
```
