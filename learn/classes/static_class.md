In Python, a static class provides a way to define a class-level functionality that can be accessed without creating an instance of the class. One of the advantages of using a static class is that it allows you to group related functions together within a class. To create a static method in a Python class, you can use the `@staticmethod` decorator. Once created, you can call the static method directly from the class without creating an instance of it. In this article, we will explore the concept of Python static classes and how to create and call a static method in a class.  
  
## Understanding Python static classes  

Python static class is a class that does not require an instance to be created. It is created using the `@staticmethod` decorator in a class definition. A static method doesn't have access to the instance, and it also can't modify the class itself. 

### How to use a Python static class and call static method in class?

```python
class MyClass:
    @staticmethod
    def static_method():
        print("This is a static method in a class")
        
MyClass.static_method()   # Output: This is a static method in a class
```

In the above example, `static_method()` is a static method in `MyClass`. It can be called using the class name without an instance of the class.

```python
class Calculator:
    @staticmethod
    def add_numbers(x, y):
        return x + y
        
result = Calculator.add_numbers(3, 5)
print(result)   # Output: 8
```

In the above example, the `add_numbers()` static method of `Calculator` class can be called directly using the class name `Calculator`. It takes two arguments `x` and `y` and returns their sum. 

Overall, python static classes and static methods provide a way to represent functionality that doesn't depend on any instance or class variables, and can be used without creating an instance of a class.  
  
## Python class static methods  

Python allows us to create static classes and static methods within a class. A **static class in Python** is a class that doesn't require an instance of the class to be created before it is used. Meanwhile, a Python class static method is a method whose first parameter is the class itself rather than the instance of the class.

To create static classes and static methods, we simply use the `@staticmethod` decorator in Python. Here are some examples:

```python
### Example 1
class Math:
    @staticmethod
    def add(x, y):
        return x + y

    @staticmethod
    def subtract(x, y):
        return x - y
        
# To call the static methods in the class, we don't need to create an instance of the class
print(Math.add(2, 3))       # Output: 5
print(Math.subtract(5, 2))  # Output: 3
```

In the above example, we created a **static class** called **Math** that contains two **static methods** called **add** and **subtract**. We can call these methods directly from the class without the need to create an instance of the class.

```python
### Example 2
class Person:
    count = 0

    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name
        Person.count += 1

    @staticmethod
    def total_people():
        return f"There are {Person.count} people."

# Create some instances of Person
person1 = Person("John")
person2 = Person("Jane")
person3 = Person("Jack")

# Call the static method from the class
print(Person.total_people())  # Output: There are 3 people.
```

In this example, we created a `Person` class with a **class variable** called `count` that will track the number of instances of the class created. We also created a **Python class static method** called `total_people` that will return the total number of people created. We can call this static method directly from the class.
  
## How to call a static method in a Python class  

To call a static method in a Python class, you need to define a static method using a built-in decorator `@staticmethod`. A static method doesn't require any instance to be called, instead, it is associated with the class itself. 

```python
### Example 1
class MyClass:
    
    @staticmethod  ### Defining static method

    def my_static_method():
        print("This is a static method.")
        
### Calling the static method using the class name

MyClass.my_static_method()   ### Output

```

```python
### Example 2
class Math:
    
    @staticmethod   ### Defining static method

    def add(a, b):
        return a + b

    @staticmethod  ### Defining static method

    def multiply(a, b):
        return a * b

### Calling the static methods in class using class name
print(Math.add(2, 3))      ### Output 5
print(Math.multiply(2, 3)) ### Output 6

```

In the above examples, we can see how to define and call a static method using the `@staticmethod` decorator in Python.  
  
## Python static classes vs. regular classes  

Static classes in Python are classes that have class-level attributes and methods that can be accessed without creating an instance of the class. They are defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator. On the other hand, regular classes in Python are the ones that require an object of the class to access attribute or methods.

### Python static class

```python
class StaticClass:
    @staticmethod
    def my_static_method():
        print("This is a static method")

# Call static method in class
StaticClass.my_static_method()
```

In the above example, we have defined a static class `StaticClass` with a static method `my_static_method`. We can call this method without creating an instance of the class.

### Python class static method

```python
class RegularClass:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def my_regular_method(self):
        print(f"Hello, {self.name}!")

    @staticmethod
    def my_static_method():
        print("This is a static method")

# Call static method in class
RegularClass.my_static_method()

# Create object of class and call regular method
obj = RegularClass("John")
obj.my_regular_method()
```

In this example, we have defined a regular class `RegularClass` with two methods, a regular method `my_regular_method`, and a static method `my_static_method`. We can call the static method without creating an instance of the class, and we can call the regular method by creating an object of the class and accessing it using the object.

In summary, using static classes can be useful if you need to define utility functions that can be accessed without creating an instance of the class. Regular classes are useful when you need to define data structures and operations that involve instances of those data structures.  
  
## Use static classes in Python

Static classes in Python are classes that are used to group functions that cannot be classified under existing classes. These classes do not require an instance of the class to be created in order to be accessed. Instead, static methods can be called directly from the class itself. Here are some of the top benefits of using static classes in Python:

1. **Namespace organization** - Static classes can be used to organize functions that do not fit well under any existing class. This helps in maintaining a clean and organized code structure.

2. **Code reusability** - Static classes can be reused across multiple modules and functions, making the code reusable and easy to maintain.

3. **Improved code readability** - Static classes make it easier to read and understand the code, as the functions are grouped under a single class and can be accessed directly.

```python
### Example 1
class MathUtils:
    @staticmethod
    def add_numbers(a, b):
        return a + b

result = MathUtils.add_numbers(2, 3)
print(result)
```

In this example, we have created a static class `MathUtils` and defined a static method `add_numbers` that takes two arguments and returns their sum. The static method can be called directly from the class `MathUtils` without creating an instance of the class.

```python
### Example 2
class StringUtils:
    @staticmethod
    def reverse_string(string):
        return string[::-1]

class TextUtils:
    @staticmethod
    def reverse_and_uppercase(string):
        reversed_string = StringUtils.reverse_string(string)
        return reversed_string.upper()

result = TextUtils.reverse_and_uppercase("Hello World")
print(result)
```

In this example, we have created two static classes `StringUtils` and `TextUtils`. The `StringUtils` class contains a static method `reverse_string` that returns a reversed string. The `TextUtils` class contains a static method `reverse_and_uppercase` that calls the `reverse_string` method from the `StringUtils` class and returns the reversed string in uppercase. 

By using static classes in Python, we can improve code organization, reusability, and readability.
